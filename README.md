## It is I...Lisa
I am Lisa. 35 years of age.
Currently I'm trying to advance my knowledge in programming. Before that I worked freelance as a interdisciplinary designer and did a short bootcamp for data science. 
I tried to find a job as a data analyst but had no success so I hope this course will help me :)

In my free time I like to read, play games (analog & digital), listen to music, cook and do 1000 other things.
